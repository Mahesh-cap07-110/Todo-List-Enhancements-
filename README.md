# Todo-List-Enhancements-

In working on this ToDo List application, 

1. I learned how to manage more complex state interactions in React. 

2. Handling user input, updating state based on user actions such as adding, deleting, and marking items as completed, and implementing conditional rendering for completed items were key aspects of this assignment. 

3. Additionally, applying CSS styling improved the visual appeal and usability of the application, making it more intuitive for users to interact with.
